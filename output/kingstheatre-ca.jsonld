He continues to evolve as an artist by “doing it his way”, an effort that has been rewarded with an impressive song catalogue and a loyal fan base.</p> <p>Alfie Zappacosta decided on a music career in his teens and set his sights upon being a guitarist. When his vocal dexterity and song writing proficiency were uncovered by a publisher while writing for his first original band “Surrender”, events would be put in motion to champion Zappacosta (dropping his first name) as a solo artist and bring him to the world’s attention. “Start Again”, “Passion”, “When I Fall in Love Again” and “Nothing Can Stand In Your Way” became staples on Canadian adult contemporary radio and Zappacosta became a personified Rock Star.</p> <div class='row_col_wrap_12_inner col span_12 left'> <div class='vc_col-sm-6 wpb_column column_container vc_column_container col child_column has-animation padding-3-percent inherit_tablet inherit_phone triggered-animation animated-in' data-padding-pos='top-bottom' data-has-bg-color='false' data-bg-color='' data-bg-opacity='1' data-animation='fade-in-from-bottom' data-delay='100'> <div class='vc_column-inner'> <div class='wpb_wrapper'> <div class='wpb_text_column wpb_content_element vc_custom_1653346740665'> <div class='wpb_wrapper'> <p>In 1987, Walt Disney’s Danger Bay would bring Zappacosta an episode written specifically for him titled “Rock Star”.

The love of programs with great diversity motivated the four musicians to create an evening with works for one, two and four guitars. Works by Handel, Bach and other baroque composers, as well as classical and romantic music, but also modern music dedicated to the duos by Dale Kavanagh and Carlo Domenico make up the Guitar Gala Night &#8211; a concert evening with virtuoso, lyrical and expressive music full of temperament.</p> <p>The Amadeus Guitar Duo with Canadian guitarist Dale Kavanagh and Thomas Kirchhoff of Germany have been playing together since 1992. They performed more than 1.800 concerts in over 80 countries around the world and have produced 20 CDs (NAXOS Int.) – they are regarded as one of the best classical guitar duos of our time. The Canadian Cormier-Martin Duo have been playing together since 2010.

He continues to evolve as an artist by “doing it his way”, an effort that has been rewarded with an impressive song catalogue and a loyal fan base.</p> <p>Alfie Zappacosta decided on a music career in his teens and set his sights upon being a guitarist. When his vocal dexterity and song writing proficiency were uncovered by a publisher while writing for his first original band “Surrender”, events would be put in motion to champion Zappacosta (dropping his first name) as a solo artist and bring him to the world’s attention. “Start Again”, “Passion”, “When I Fall in Love Again” and “Nothing Can Stand In Your Way” became staples on Canadian adult contemporary radio and Zappacosta became a personified Rock Star.</p> <div class='row_col_wrap_12_inner col span_12 left'> <div class='vc_col-sm-6 wpb_column column_container vc_column_container col child_column has-animation padding-3-percent inherit_tablet inherit_phone triggered-animation animated-in' data-padding-pos='top-bottom' data-has-bg-color='false' data-bg-color='' data-bg-opacity='1' data-animation='fade-in-from-bottom' data-delay='100'> <div class='vc_column-inner'> <div class='wpb_wrapper'> <div class='wpb_text_column wpb_content_element vc_custom_1653346740665'> <div class='wpb_wrapper'> <p>In 1987, Walt Disney’s Danger Bay would bring Zappacosta an episode written specifically for him titled “Rock Star”.

The love of programs with great diversity motivated the four musicians to create an evening with works for one, two and four guitars. Works by Handel, Bach and other baroque composers, as well as classical and romantic music, but also modern music dedicated to the duos by Dale Kavanagh and Carlo Domenico make up the Guitar Gala Night &#8211; a concert evening with virtuoso, lyrical and expressive music full of temperament.</p> <p>The Amadeus Guitar Duo with Canadian guitarist Dale Kavanagh and Thomas Kirchhoff of Germany have been playing together since 1992. They performed more than 1.800 concerts in over 80 countries around the world and have produced 20 CDs (NAXOS Int.) – they are regarded as one of the best classical guitar duos of our time. The Canadian Cormier-Martin Duo have been playing together since 2010.
