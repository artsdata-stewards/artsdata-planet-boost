Buckle up and let The Geezers, Sid Filkow and Patrick Cassidy, take you on a comedy joyride as they navigate the potholes of Island life—and life itself. Think Monty Python colliding head-on with the Three Stooges.\nThis show honours the comedy legacy that began several decades ago when Sid Filkow and Arvid Chalmers first created the original Geezers. Now, with Patrick Cassidy joining Sid, the tradition continues, blending classic absurdity with fresh new antics.\nAbout the performers:\nSid Filkow is a long-time local comedy legend and an award-winning playwright. From his past work with The Geezers to his most recent original sketch show, SutureSelf (Fall 2024), Sid has delighted audiences with wit, insight, and irreverent humour.\nPatrick Cassidy has graced local stages in numerous productions. He is perhaps best known for his memorable performance as Scrooge in the beloved Newman Family’s production of Scrooge, as well as his hilarious portrayal of Patsy in Monty Python’s Spamalot.\nTogether, Sid and Patrick keep the Geezers spirit alive—because laughter never gets old. Join us for a forgetful, we mean unforgettable night.\nBUY TICKETS\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t Details \n\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tDate:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t October 30, 2025 \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tTime:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t7:30 pm - 9:30 pm\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\tSeries: \n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tTHE GEEZERS — EXPECT DELAYS\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tCost:\n\t\t\t\t $15 – $30 \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tEvent Category: Rental\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWebsite:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t graffititheatre.org \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\tOrganizer\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tGraffiti Theatre\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t Venue \n\t\n\t\t\t\t ArtSpring – Theatre \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n100 Jackson Avenue\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\tSalt Spring Island,\n\n\tBC\n\n\tV8K 2V8\n\n\tCanada\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t+ Google Map\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPhone\n\t\t\t\t\t 250.537.2102 \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAdd to calendar\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tGoogle Calendar\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tiCalendar\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tOutlook 365\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tOutlook Live\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t Details \n\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tDate:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t October 30, 2025 \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tTime:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t7:30 pm - 9:30 pm\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\tSeries: \n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tTHE GEEZERS — EXPECT DELAYS\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tCost:\n\t\t\t\t $15 – $30 \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tEvent Category: Rental\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWebsite:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t graffititheatre.org \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\tOrganizer\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tGraffiti Theatre\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t Venue \n\t\n\t\t\t\t ArtSpring – Theatre \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n100 Jackson Avenue\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\tSalt Spring Island,\n\n\tBC\n\n\tV8K 2V8\n\n\tCanada\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t+ Google Map\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPhone\n\t\t\t\t\t 250.537.2102 \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t \n\n\t\n\t\n    \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tEvent Navigation\n\t\t\n\t\t\t« Salt Spring Film Festival presents HAVE YOU HEARD JUDI SINGH?\n\t\t\tLobby Exhibition: New and Selected Paintings by Margarite Sánchez »\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t"

Created and curated by filmmaker and photographer Alan Bibby, the screenings explore themes of memory, resilience, and the lasting emotional impact of conflict.\nInterwoven with the films, live musical performances will bring an additional layer of emotion and connection. Renowned Canadian singer-songwriter Valdy will be joined by guest musicians, offering heartfelt songs of reflection, remembrance, and hope.\nWhether you’re a veteran, a family member, or simply a community member seeking to honour those who have served, this evening promises a deeply meaningful experience.\nAdmission by donation.

As its hidden history emerges and a new owner restores it to its former glory, the tale unfolds of a remarkable friendship between two men across eight decades and their lifelong commitment to environmental activism through art & science.\nFrom award-winning filmmaker Alison Reid (THE WOMAN WHO LOVES GIRAFFES), this unmissable around-the-world journey is both an endearingly entertaining buddy film and an environmental love letter.\nBUY TICKETS\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t Details \n\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tDate:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t November 12, 2025 \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tTime:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t3:00 pm - 5:30 pm\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tCost:\n\t\t\t\t $14 – $15 \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tEvent Category: Film\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWebsite:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t saltspringfilmfestival.com \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\tOrganizer\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tSalt Spring Film Festival\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tView Organizer Website\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t Venue \n\t\n\t\t\t\t ArtSpring – Theatre \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n100 Jackson Avenue\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\tSalt Spring Island,\n\n\tBC\n\n\tV8K 2V8\n\n\tCanada\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t+ Google Map\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPhone\n\t\t\t\t\t 250.537.2102 \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAdd to calendar\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tGoogle Calendar\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tiCalendar\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tOutlook 365\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tOutlook Live\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t Details \n\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tDate:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t November 12, 2025 \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tTime:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t3:00 pm - 5:30 pm\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tCost:\n\t\t\t\t $14 – $15 \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tEvent Category: Film\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWebsite:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t saltspringfilmfestival.com \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\tOrganizer\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tSalt Spring Film Festival\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tView Organizer Website\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t Venue \n\t\n\t\t\t\t ArtSpring – Theatre \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n100 Jackson Avenue\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\tSalt Spring Island,\n\n\tBC\n\n\tV8K 2V8\n\n\tCanada\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t+ Google Map\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPhone\n\t\t\t\t\t 250.537.2102 \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t \n\n\t\n\t\n    \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tEvent Navigation\n\t\t\n\t\t\t« ArtSpring RoundTable Presents – What These Eyes Have Seen – Film & Music Evening\n\t\t\tSalt Spring Film Festival presents THE ART OF ADVENTURE »\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t"

They’re the people you meet when you come to our shows, and they’re the ones you don’t see as they work tirelessly behind the scenes. Some of our volunteers have even been with us since day one!\nHere’s what’s involved in some of our year-round roles:\nDaytime box office job description (pdf)\nPre-show box office job description (pdf)\nUsher job description (pdf)\nWe’d love to hear from you if you’d like to a part of this dedicated team.

Bookings may be made up to two years in advance.\nCan I hold dates in the theatre?\nYou may place available dates on hold and you may cancel held dates at any time prior to signing the contract. If your held dates are requested by another client who is willing to sign the contract and pay the deposit, ArtSpring will contact you and offer you first right of refusal. You will have a few business days to make a decision – at which point you must sign the contract and pay the deposit or release the dates. Bookings are only confirmed when you have signed the contract and paid the deposit.\nDo I need to pay a deposit to secure a date in the theatre?\nYes, you must pay the deposit and sign the contract in order to confirm a booking.

If you wish to arrange your own concession, kitchen use must be confirmed with the Operations Manager (meghan@artspring.ca) when you sign the contract and pay your deposit. In the event that you wish to serve alcohol as part of your concession it is your responsibility to apply for, secure, and post a Special Occasion liquor license and abide by all rules and regulations stipulated in that license. In this situation, ArtSpring will require you to purchase liability insurance.\nDo I need insurance for my event at ArtSpring?\nIf you answer yes to any of the questions found on ArtSpring’s insurance questionnaire you are required to have liability insurance for your event.\nDoes ArtSpring provide all technical staff for a show/event?\nYes, ArtSpring’s Technical Director (TD) is in-house for all performances, rehearsals and most other uses of the theatre. The TD will determine and schedule all other labour required for your event or production and has ultimate authority in the theatre. Subject to approval by ArtSpring’s TD, you may bring in your own professional sound technician. The technical staffing fees charged by ArtSpring will not be reduced in this situation. ArtSpring requires their own staff to be in place for all performances/events in the theatre to ensure proper and safe use of the facility and equipment. These staffing levels are determined by the Technical Director and are not affected by any outside technical assistance you may bring in for your production.\nWhere can I find details about the theatre’s features, equipment or layout?\nYou can find information about theatre features, equipment, layout, etc here.\nWhat marketing assistance does ArtSpring provide?\nYou are responsible for marketing your event.

Gallery bookings can be confirmed 90 days prior to your event.\nCan I sell tickets myself using another ticketing platform?\nNo, all events taking place at ArtSpring must sell tickets through the ArtSpring Box Office.

We cannot accommodate early arrivals, including equipment drop-off, catering items, etc. Please ensure everyone involved with your production is aware of the scheduled load-in times.\nDoes ArtSpring have any COVID policies?\nPlease check our COVID-19 Safety page for current policies.\n"

As the rental client, you understand and agree that you may be alone in the building, that you will not leave the building unoccupied at any time, and that you will wait for ArtSpring staff to arrive before you leave.\nWhen an evening performance is scheduled in the theatre, rental clients are encouraged to open their exhibitions to the public before the performance and during intermission; however, this is at the discretion of the exhibitor. There is no additional rental charge for such use.\nAm I required to have insurance for my event at ArtSpring?\nIf you answer yes to any of the questions found on ArtSpring’s insurance questionnaire you are required to have liability insurance for your event.

Only ArtSpring staff are permitted to move dividing walls or focus lighting.\nDoes ArtSpring take a commission on art sales?\nNo, sales are exclusive to the rental client.\nCan ArtSpring process art sales for me?\nArtSpring prefers that the rental client (or the client’s representative) who is “sitting” the show sell work and receive payment. However, if necessary ArtSpring can assist with sales paid by debit or credit card through the Box Office during regular hours (subject to certain conditions and procedures – see Operations Manager for more details). Payment will be remitted to exhibitor 10 business days after the exhibition ends, minus any associated credit card or debit charges.\nWhat marketing assistance does ArtSpring provide?\nYou are responsible for marketing your exhibit.

Ensure those engaged in cleaning have adequate training and materials.\n• Remove any unnecessary tools or equipment that may elevate the risk of transmission, including items like coffee makers and shared utensils and plates.\nDevelop policies\nDevelop policies to manage the risks in the workplace including:\n• Who (of the staff) can be in the workspace\n• limit visitors\nThe provincial health officer and the BC CDC have issued the following guidance around self-isolation:\no anyone who has had symptoms of disease must stay at home; symptoms include fever, chills, new or worsening cough, shortness of breath, sore throat and new muscle aches or headache.\no anyone under the direction of the provincial health officer to self-isolate must follow those instructions\n• What if you start to feel sick at work? Notify the Executive & Artistic Director and go home. Provide a list to the EAD of people you may have come in contact to at work.\nDevelop communication plans and training\nYou must ensure that everyone entering the workplace, including workers from other employers, knows how to keep themselves safe while at your workplace.\n• Be sure everyone is trained on the measures you have put in place and the policies around staying home when sick.\n• Post signage, including occupancy limits and effective handwashing practices. Signage should also be posted at the main entrance indicating who is restricted from entering the premises (including visitors and workers with symptoms).\n• Ensure supervisors have been trained on monitoring workers and workplace to ensure policies and procedures are being followed.\n"

ArtSpring will use your information for situations that can reasonably be considered appropriate in the circumstances and that fulfill the purposes for which it was originally collected.\nEach time you provide us with information, by doing so you are accepting the practices described in this privacy policy at that time. You agree that you are consenting to our use and disclosure of the information that you provide.\nWith respect to personal information already collected by ArtSpring prior to the publication of this Privacy Policy, the Policy will constitute reasonable notice to ArtSpring’s patrons of the purposes and uses for which such personal information has been collected. Consent may be withdrawn upon notice.\nWhen personal information that has been collected is to be used for a purpose not previously identified, the new purpose will be identified prior to use. Unless the new purpose is required by law, ArtSpring will obtain the consent of the individual before information is used for that new purpose.\n“ArtSpring” is used in this document to represent all representatives of the Island Arts Centre Society and ArtSpring, including volunteers and staff.\nWhat is personal information?\n“Personal information” is information about an identifiable individual but does not include contact information.\nWhat information does ArtSpring collect and for what purposes?\nArtSpring collects contact information (i.e., information that could be used to contact you such as full name, postal address, phone number and email address) in order to help us efficiently perform transactions on the box office, to deliver the services you have requested, to perform quality assurance, sales analyses and other business analyses, and to contact you in connection with events for which you purchased tickets (including event confirmations, changes and cancellations).\nWe also collect demographic information (i.e., postal code, hometown, purchase history information) in order to provide you with information on events and services that may be of interest to you.\nBy becoming an ArtSpring (Island Arts Centre Society) member, donor and/or patron, we believe you are demonstrating interest in ArtSpring. We therefore believe it is reasonable that you would like to be informed about ArtSpring activities. This will allow ArtSpring to contact you using the contact information you provided.\nPersons collecting the information will be able to explain to you the purposes for which the information is being collected, or will refer you to a designated person at ArtSpring who will explain the purposes.\nHow is consent obtained?\nArtSpring will generally seek consent for the use or disclosure of the information at the time of collection. The form of consent sought by ArtSpring may vary, depending upon the circumstances and the type of information disclosed.\nExpress consent will be sought when the information is considered sensitive. Implied consent will generally be appropriate when the information is less sensitive (i.e. contact and demographic information as outlined above).\nBy using ArtSpring’s box office you are accepting the practices described in this privacy policy at that time. After you provide the box office with contact information (which is done at the time of purchasing tickets or other box office transaction), you have the opportunity to tell us not to use that information to send you promotional materials. Express consent is required to opt into the newsletter email.\nDo I need to provide contact or personal information?\nNo, but you need to know that box office services will be less efficient without your contact information. For example, if you were to lose your tickets ArtSpring would not be able to reprint them if you declined to give us your contact info. ArtSpring would also be unable to contact you directly if a show had been cancelled. Providing information is not a condition to access services provided by ArtSpring’s box office.\nMay I withdraw consent?\nYour verbal or written request to be removed from ArtSpring’s records will be honored within 48 hours after receipt of request.\nCan I be sure the information is accurate?\nArtSpring will endeavour to keep information accurate, complete, and up-to-date. ArtSpring will not routinely update information unless such a process is necessary to fulfill the purpose for which the information was collected. You may access your information and request information to be up-dated.\nIs my contact information shared with other, third party organizations?\nBy purchasing tickets, we believe you are demonstrating an interest in that type of event and its producer. We therefore believe it is reasonable that you would like to be informed about other events sponsored by that producer or about events of a similar nature. This will allow ArtSpring to contact you using the contact information you provided.\nArtSpring will not share your contact information with third parties.\nWe may disclose specific contact information when we determine that such disclosure is necessary to comply with law, to cooperate with law enforcement or to protect the interests or safety of ArtSpring and its user groups.\nIs it possible to remain on the contact list so that I receive information from ArtSpring, but my information is not traded with a third party?\nYes. Please make this request known to the box office.\nWhat limitations are put on the usage of contact information?\nWhen you use ArtSpring’s box office to order tickets and to make other transactions, you provide your contact information to ArtSpring. The information may then be used by ArtSpring to keep you informed of activities sponsored by ArtSpring and its user-groups.\nArtSpring will endeavor to ensure the information is used only for purposes that seem reasonable and that conform to the intentions of information collection (see above). Information will be kept only as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected.\nArtSpring will not make available to third parties lists of Island Arts Centre Society members and donors, or lists of patrons who attended ArtSpring-presented events. Third parties will also be denied access to information for patrons who did not attend events sponsored by the requesting party. If we contract service providers to help us perform tasks such as fulfilling your orders or performing customer service, business analyses or quality control, consequently we may share your information with these service providers. In such cases, we will require these service providers to enter into agreements with us regarding the confidential handling of your information.\nArtSpring will not be responsible or otherwise liable for any use or disclosure of your contact information by a third party to whom ArtSpring is allowed to disclose your contact information under this privacy policy.\nHow will my financial information be used?\nWe use your financial information to help us efficiently perform sales and other transactions, to deliver the goods and services you have requested, and to perform quality assurance.\nYour financial information will not be provided to third parties.\nArtSpring’s box office volunteer staff or administrative staff will be responsible for dispute resolution and customer service related to collection of payment.\nWe may disclose specific financial information when we determine that such disclosure is necessary to comply with law, to cooperate with law enforcement or to protect the interests or safety of ArtSpring or its user groups.\nHow is my contact information protected?\nInformation contained on the box office computer is password protected. Other measures of protection include locked file cabinets and restricted access to offices.\nArtSpring staff (paid, contract, and volunteer) who work with contact information are required to sign confidentiality forms.\nArtSpring will use care in the disposal or destruction of personal information to prevent unauthorized parties from gaining access to the information.\nWho is accountable for the information collected by ArtSpring?\nArtSpring’s Executive Director is responsible for personal information under ArtSpring’s control. The Executive Director will oversee ArtSpring’s compliance with the principles contained in the Privacy Policy.\nArtSpring’s Executive Director will implement policies and practices to give effect to the principles, including:\n* Implementing procedures to protect personal information;\n* Establishing procedures to receive and respond to complaints and inquiries;\n* Training ArtSpring representatives and communicating to ArtSpring representatives information about ArtSpring’s policies and practices;\n* Developing information to explain ArtSpring’s policies and practices.\nHow do I make a complaint?\nIf you have a complaint related to ArtSpring’s Privacy Policy or any of our procedures, please contact the Executive Director. All written and verbal complaints will be investigated and, if justified, we will take the steps necessary to resolve the issue, including amending our policy and practices, if necessary.\nIf we are not able to resolve your concern, or if you have any other concerns about ArtSpring’s Privacy Policy, you may contact British Columbia’s Privacy Commissioner. We will provide you with contact information upon request.\nIf you have any questions or concerns about this privacy policy related to box office services, you can contact us at info@artspring.ca.\nYou can also contact us by mail or by phone:\nArtSpring\n100 Jackson Ave.\nSalt Spring Island, BC\nV8K 2V8\n(250) 537-2125\nlast updated: August 6, 2020\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t"

The tale follows the adventures of Mowzer the cat and her faithful human fisher, Tom Bawcock. This is a traditional story hailing from Cornwall, England. Every year to this day, the town of Mousehole celebrates this tale with a lantern festival and a seafood feast. This is a heartwarming story of bravery, courage and the desire to help. There will also be a sing along portion so you can join in the holiday music making – and there will be lots of holiday treats available too! Members of the foodbank will be present to write tax receipts for any donations.\nBring your sweet tooth, and your singing voice. All proceeds go to the foodbank. In addition to cash or cheques, food donations will also be gratefully accepted in support of our community!!\nBUY TICKETS\nIntermission | Concession | $25 Adult (incl $20 Food Bank Donation) | $5 Adult | $2 Youth\n \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t Details \n\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tDate:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t December 19, 2025 \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tTime:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t7:00 pm - 9:00 pm\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tCost:\n\t\t\t\t $2 – $25 \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tEvent Category: Rental\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWebsite:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t vivachoralesaltspring.com \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\tOrganizer\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tViva Chorale!\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tView Organizer Website\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t Venue \n\t\n\t\t\t\t ArtSpring – Theatre \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n100 Jackson Avenue\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\tSalt Spring Island,\n\n\tBC\n\n\tV8K 2V8\n\n\tCanada\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t+ Google Map\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPhone\n\t\t\t\t\t 250.537.2102 \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAdd to calendar\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tGoogle Calendar\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tiCalendar\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tOutlook 365\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tOutlook Live\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t Details \n\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tDate:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t December 19, 2025 \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tTime:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t7:00 pm - 9:00 pm\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tCost:\n\t\t\t\t $2 – $25 \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tEvent Category: Rental\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWebsite:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t vivachoralesaltspring.com \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\tOrganizer\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tViva Chorale!\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tView Organizer Website\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t Venue \n\t\n\t\t\t\t ArtSpring – Theatre \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n100 Jackson Avenue\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\tSalt Spring Island,\n\n\tBC\n\n\tV8K 2V8\n\n\tCanada\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t+ Google Map\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPhone\n\t\t\t\t\t 250.537.2102 \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t \n\n\t\n\t\n    \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tEvent Navigation\n\t\t\n\t\t\t« GISS Music Presents: Musaic\n\t\t\tMET OPERA: I Puritani (Bellini) »\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t"

As climate change reveals the location of some of the previously missing human remains, Nepalese national hero Mingma Tsiri Sherpa – considered one of the best high-altitude climbers of all time – leads an elite team of fellow Sherpas into the Death Zone, repeatedly risking their lives to sanctify the mountain by retrieving one body at a time, so that they can be repatriated and laid to rest.\nFeaturing spectacular aerial cinematography & reverential respect for a distinctly non-European worldview, don’t miss this jaw-dropping, award-winning film from Vancouver filmmaker Jereme Watt.\nCo-presented by Salt Spring Search and Rescue\nBUY TICKETS\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t Details \n\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tDate:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t January 21, 2026 \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tTime:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t7:30 pm - 9:30 pm\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tCost:\n\t\t\t\t $14 – $15 \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tEvent Category: Film\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWebsite:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t saltspringfilmfestival.com \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\tOrganizer\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tSalt Spring Film Festival\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tView Organizer Website\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t Venue \n\t\n\t\t\t\t ArtSpring – Theatre \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n100 Jackson Avenue\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\tSalt Spring Island,\n\n\tBC\n\n\tV8K 2V8\n\n\tCanada\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t+ Google Map\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPhone\n\t\t\t\t\t 250.537.2102 \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAdd to calendar\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tGoogle Calendar\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tiCalendar\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tOutlook 365\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tOutlook Live\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t Details \n\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tDate:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t January 21, 2026 \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tTime:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t7:30 pm - 9:30 pm\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tCost:\n\t\t\t\t $14 – $15 \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tEvent Category: Film\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWebsite:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t saltspringfilmfestival.com \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\tOrganizer\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tSalt Spring Film Festival\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tView Organizer Website\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t Venue \n\t\n\t\t\t\t ArtSpring – Theatre \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n100 Jackson Avenue\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\tSalt Spring Island,\n\n\tBC\n\n\tV8K 2V8\n\n\tCanada\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t+ Google Map\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPhone\n\t\t\t\t\t 250.537.2102 \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t \n\n\t\n\t\n    \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tEvent Navigation\n\t\t\n\t\t\t« VICTORIA BAROQUE: Of Gods & Men\n\t\t\tThe Fretless »\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t"

Featuring workshops in filmmaking, costume design, Indigenous Circle Gathering and youth choir performances.\nCorey Payette is an award-winning Anishinaabe composer whose musicals have toured on stages across the country, and whose voice has been heard in some of the world’s most iconic venues from Carnegie Hall in NYC to performances with the National Arts Centre Orchestra.\nFRI JAN 30: Witness a reimagining of Canadian history through Indigenous voices, music, and language. Les Filles du Roi is a ground-breaking musical by acclaimed writer, composer, and director Corey Payette, in collaboration with co-creator Julie\nMcIsaac. Told in English, French, and Kanien’kéha (Mohawk), the story follows Kateri and Jean-Baptiste, two Mohawk siblings whose lives intersect with a young French immigrant, Marie-Jeanne, in 1665 “New France.” What begins as a colonial encounter unfolds into a rich narrative of resilience, kinship, and transformation—blending cultures, challenging assumptions, and reshaping the story of who we are.\nNight one features the stunning feature film adaptation of the musical, directed by Payette, and celebrated at TIFF and festivals worldwide. This cinematic version brings the theatrical work to life in breathtaking visual and musical detail.\nBUY FILM TICKETS\nSAT JAN 31: Night two is an extraordinary live concert experience, Closest Thing To Home, featuring selections from his acclaimed musicals Children of God, Les Filles du Roi, Sedna, Starwalker, and upcoming new musical On Native Land, the concert is a sweeping celebration of resilience, love, resistance, and the search for belonging. Payette is joined by a stellar group of special guests, a small chamber orchestra, and local choirs in a powerful evening of music. With soaring vocals, lush arrangements, and unforgettable music, Closest Thing to Home is both intimate and grand in scale. It promises to be a moving reflection on the stories that shape us, the lands that hold us, and the music that brings us home.\nThis is more than performance—it’s a cultural reckoning, a reclamation, and an invitation to reimagine the founding myths of this country. Moving, unforgettable, and artistically daring, it speaks to the heart of truth, reconciliation, and the power of song.\n75 – 80 min | No Intermission\nBUY CONCERT TICKETS\nThank you to Victoria Olchowecki and Gérald Tibbits for sponsoring this performance.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t Details \n\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tDate:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t January 31, 2026 \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tTime:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t7:30 pm - 9:30 pm\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tCost:\n\t\t\t\t $10 – $42 \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWebsite:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t artspring.ca \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\tOrganizer\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tArtSpring\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t Venue \n\t\n\t\t\t\t ArtSpring – Theatre \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n100 Jackson Avenue\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\tSalt Spring Island,\n\n\tBC\n\n\tV8K 2V8\n\n\tCanada\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t+ Google Map\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPhone\n\t\t\t\t\t 250.537.2102 \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAdd to calendar\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tGoogle Calendar\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tiCalendar\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tOutlook 365\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tOutlook Live\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t Details \n\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tDate:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t January 31, 2026 \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tTime:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t7:30 pm - 9:30 pm\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tCost:\n\t\t\t\t $10 – $42 \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWebsite:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t artspring.ca \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\tOrganizer\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tArtSpring\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t Venue \n\t\n\t\t\t\t ArtSpring – Theatre \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n100 Jackson Avenue\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\tSalt Spring Island,\n\n\tBC\n\n\tV8K 2V8\n\n\tCanada\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t+ Google Map\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPhone\n\t\t\t\t\t 250.537.2102 \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t \n\n\t\n\t\n    \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tEvent Navigation\n\t\t\n\t\t\t« COREY PAYETTE: LES FILLES du ROI (The King’s Daughters)\n\t\t\tRoyal Winnipeg Ballet »\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t"

Bear Grease dares to reimagine the iconic 1972 musical Grease through a bold and comedic Indigenous lens. With a powwow-powered soundtrack and hip-hop flair, this high-energy, all-Indigenous production transforms classic hits into cultural celebration: “Hopelessly Devoted” becomes a Round Dance, “Bear Grease Lightning” pulses with traditional footwork, and “Wichihin” offers a powerful new take on “Stand by Me.”\nCreated by husband-and-wife duo LightningCloud, Bear Grease is a grassroots response to the lack of Indigenous representation in theatre. Now a touring sensation with over 200 performances and an Off-Broadway debut, the show has captivated audiences across North America.\nBlending language, dance, humour, and heart, Bear Grease is a hilarious homage, a cultural reclamation, and an unforgettable experience that leaves audiences laughing, cheering, and deeply moved.\nWe acknowledge “Bear Grease the Musical” was written in Treaty 6 Alberta, land and traditional territories of the Nehiyaw (Cree), Denesuline’ (Dene), Nakota Sioux (Stoney), Anishinaabe (Saulteaux) and Niitsitapi (Blackfoot)\nBUY TICKETS\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t Details \n\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tDate:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t December 9, 2025 \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tTime:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t7:30 pm - 9:30 pm\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\tSeries: \n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tBEAR GREASE THE MUSICAL\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tCost:\n\t\t\t\t $10 – $42 \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tEvent Category: ArtSpring Presents 2025-26\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWebsite:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t artspring.ca \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\tOrganizer\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tArtSpring\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t Venue \n\t\n\t\t\t\t ArtSpring – Theatre \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n100 Jackson Avenue\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\tSalt Spring Island,\n\n\tBC\n\n\tV8K 2V8\n\n\tCanada\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t+ Google Map\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPhone\n\t\t\t\t\t 250.537.2102 \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAdd to calendar\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tGoogle Calendar\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tiCalendar\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tOutlook 365\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tOutlook Live\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t Details \n\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tDate:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t December 9, 2025 \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tTime:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t7:30 pm - 9:30 pm\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\tSeries: \n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tBEAR GREASE THE MUSICAL\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tCost:\n\t\t\t\t $10 – $42 \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tEvent Category: ArtSpring Presents 2025-26\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWebsite:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t artspring.ca \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\tOrganizer\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tArtSpring\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t Venue \n\t\n\t\t\t\t ArtSpring – Theatre \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n100 Jackson Avenue\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\tSalt Spring Island,\n\n\tBC\n\n\tV8K 2V8\n\n\tCanada\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t+ Google Map\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPhone\n\t\t\t\t\t 250.537.2102 \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t \n\n\t\n\t\n    \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tEvent Navigation\n\t\t\n\t\t\t« BEAR GREASE THE MUSICAL\n\t\t\tMET OPERA: Andrea Chenier (Giordano) »\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t"

A Two-Spirit song carrier and classically trained tenor of the Neqotkuk (Tobique First Nation) in Eastern Canada, Dutcher bridges the traditional and the contemporary in electrifying ways. His debut album Wolastoqiyik Lintuwakonawa unearthed archival recordings of his ancestors and transformed them into sweeping, genre-defying compositions—sung entirely in Wolastoqey, his endangered Indigenous language.\n\n\nIt won the Polaris Music Prize in 2018. He did it again in 2024 with Motewolonuwok—becoming the first artist in history to win twice.\n\n\nDutcher’s live performances are theatrical, deeply emotional, and rich with musical storytelling. With a sound that moves between grand piano, operatic tenor, jazz, and traditional Wolastoqey song, his concerts are both reverent and radical—described by NPR as “music like no other,” and by CBC as “moment-defining.”\n\n\nBeyond the stage, Dutcher is a public thinker and activist on Indigeneity, queerness, and language revitalization. He has collaborated with artists like Yo-Yo Ma and Feist, and been profiled in Vogue, Rolling Stone, and The Globe and Mail.\n\n\nThis is more than a concert. It’s an encounter with living history, contemporary brilliance, and the transformative power of art.\nBUY TICKETS\nThis is a marquee event. Adult tickets are $60.

The work draws from queer intimacy and kink practices, conjuring the simultaneous danger and care inherent to marginal spaces.\n3:30pm-4:30pm\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t Details \n\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tDate:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t March 28, 2025 \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tTime:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t3:30 pm - 4:30 pm\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tEvent Category: Dance\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\tOrganizer\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tArtSpring\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t Venue \n\t\n\t\t\t\t ArtSpring – Theatre \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n100 Jackson Avenue\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\tSalt Spring Island,\n\n\tBC\n\n\tV8K 2V8\n\n\tCanada\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t+ Google Map\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPhone\n\t\t\t\t\t 250.537.2102 \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAdd to calendar\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tGoogle Calendar\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tiCalendar\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tOutlook 365\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tOutlook Live\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t Details \n\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tDate:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t March 28, 2025 \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tTime:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t3:30 pm - 4:30 pm\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tEvent Category: Dance\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\tOrganizer\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tArtSpring\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t Venue \n\t\n\t\t\t\t ArtSpring – Theatre \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n100 Jackson Avenue\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\tSalt Spring Island,\n\n\tBC\n\n\tV8K 2V8\n\n\tCanada\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t+ Google Map\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPhone\n\t\t\t\t\t 250.537.2102 \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t \n\n\t\n\t\n    \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tEvent Navigation\n\t\t\n\t\t\t« StageCoach: “Acting for Film & TV” Camp\n\t\t\tJANINA FIALKOWSKA »\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t"

This Salt Spring Forum-presented evening comes right on the heels of Simpson’s new book Chronic Condition: Why Canada’s Health Care System Needs to be Dragged into the 21st Century (Penguin, Sept. 2012).\nIn his new book, Simpson argues that medicare is the third rail of Canadian politics and that for a politician to address it seriously is political suicide. He argues that every Canadian politician knows this truism, which is why health care reform has been neglected in the national debate. In Chronic Condition, Jeffrey Simpson meets health care head on and explores the only four options we have to end this  growing crisis: cuts in spending, tax increases, privatization, and reaping savings through increased efficiency. He finds that many other countries have more  extensive public health systems, and Canadian health care produces only average value for money. Chronic Condition breaks the silence about the huge  changes and real choices that Canadians face.\nThis evening at ArtSpring with Jeffrey Simpson will be an exploration of the problems that face our current medical system and the possible solutions to these issues that impact us all.\n \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t Details \n\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tDate:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t September 30, 2012 \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tTime:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t7:30 pm - 9:30 pm\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tCost:\n\t\t\t\t $10 – $15 \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tEvent Category: Rental\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t Venue \n\t\n\t\t\t\t ArtSpring – Theatre \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n100 Jackson Avenue\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\tSalt Spring Island,\n\n\tBC\n\n\tV8K 2V8\n\n\tCanada\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPhone\n\t\t\t\t\t 250.537.2102 \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\tOrganizer\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tSalt Spring Forum\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tView Organizer Website\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t Other \n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Tickets \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\ttickets.artspring.ca\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAdd to calendar\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tGoogle Calendar\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tiCalendar\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tOutlook 365\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tOutlook Live\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t Details \n\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tDate:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t September 30, 2012 \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tTime:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t7:30 pm - 9:30 pm\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tCost:\n\t\t\t\t $10 – $15 \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tEvent Category: Rental\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t Venue \n\t\n\t\t\t\t ArtSpring – Theatre \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n100 Jackson Avenue\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\tSalt Spring Island,\n\n\tBC\n\n\tV8K 2V8\n\n\tCanada\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPhone\n\t\t\t\t\t 250.537.2102 \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\tOrganizer\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tSalt Spring Forum\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tView Organizer Website\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t Other \n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Tickets \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\ttickets.artspring.ca\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t \n\n\t\n\t\n    \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tEvent Navigation\n\t\t\n\t\t\t« Death Knocks, Yetta Gen (at Lions Hall)\n\t\t\tWealth Management Information Session »\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t"

Fifty of your talented Salt Spring neighbours have created an evening of song and dance featuring drag queens and conservatives, babies and kangaroos, palm trees and John Wayne, all erupting into the life of one man. Nineteen great songs! Not recommended for children: occasional coarse language, suggestive scenes, some nudity. (Strobe light used in show.)

Mr. Bruce Smith is pleased to end this year off with this talented group and he too will smile sadly, as he waves his Parting Glass.\nBUY TICKETS\n \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t Details \n\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tDate:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t June 13, 2018 \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tTime:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t7:30 pm - 9:00 pm\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tCost:\n\t\t\t\t $15.00 \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tEvent Category: Rental\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\tOrganizer\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tGISS Music\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t Other \n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Tickets \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\ttickets.artspring.ca\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t Venue \n\t\n\t\t\t\t ArtSpring – Theatre \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n100 Jackson Avenue\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\tSalt Spring Island,\n\n\tBC\n\n\tV8K 2V8\n\n\tCanada\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t+ Google Map\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPhone\n\t\t\t\t\t 250.537.2102 \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAdd to calendar\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tGoogle Calendar\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tiCalendar\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tOutlook 365\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tOutlook Live\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t Details \n\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tDate:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t June 13, 2018 \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tTime:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t7:30 pm - 9:00 pm\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tCost:\n\t\t\t\t $15.00 \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tEvent Category: Rental\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\tOrganizer\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tGISS Music\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t Other \n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Tickets \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\ttickets.artspring.ca\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t Venue \n\t\n\t\t\t\t ArtSpring – Theatre \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n100 Jackson Avenue\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\tSalt Spring Island,\n\n\tBC\n\n\tV8K 2V8\n\n\tCanada\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t+ Google Map\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPhone\n\t\t\t\t\t 250.537.2102 \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t \n\n\t\n\t\n    \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tEvent Navigation\n\t\t\n\t\t\t« Gilbert & Sullivan’s HMS Pinafore\n\t\t\tSS Forum: The Political Battle for BC – Richard Zussman, Legislative Reporter »\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t"

What they’ve created in nothing less than astounding.

Each of the dozen grade 9-12 dancers will have an opportunity to shine brightly in this collection of new choreography from the studio at GISS Dance. This end-of-semester show will include a wide spectrum of emotional and artistic expression. The students study Ballet, Contemporary, Jazz and Hip Hop techniques to support their artistic endeavours and the performance will display the work we’ve done this semester. Highlights include the farewell piece of choreography by five graduating dancers. Excited to dance together, these five grads have grown close through performing together for years and they are grateful for the experience. They describe, “Dance brings us close together — unites us in our physical, intellectual and emotional growth.”\nPlease come to support these vibrant and focused youth from GISS Dance!\nBUY TICKETS\n \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t Details \n\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tDate:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t June 5, 2025 \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tTime:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t7:30 pm - 9:30 pm\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\tSeries: \n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tGISS Dance presents Eclipse: A Collection of New Choreography\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tCost:\n\t\t\t\t $15 – $18 \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tEvent Categories: Dance, Rental\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWebsite:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t artspring.ca \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\tOrganizer\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tArtSpring\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t Venue \n\t\n\t\t\t\t ArtSpring – Theatre \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n100 Jackson Avenue\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\tSalt Spring Island,\n\n\tBC\n\n\tV8K 2V8\n\n\tCanada\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t+ Google Map\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPhone\n\t\t\t\t\t 250.537.2102 \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAdd to calendar\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tGoogle Calendar\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tiCalendar\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tOutlook 365\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tOutlook Live\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t Details \n\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tDate:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t June 5, 2025 \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tTime:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t7:30 pm - 9:30 pm\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\tSeries: \n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tGISS Dance presents Eclipse: A Collection of New Choreography\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tCost:\n\t\t\t\t $15 – $18 \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tEvent Categories: Dance, Rental\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWebsite:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t artspring.ca \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\tOrganizer\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tArtSpring\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t Venue \n\t\n\t\t\t\t ArtSpring – Theatre \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n100 Jackson Avenue\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\tSalt Spring Island,\n\n\tBC\n\n\tV8K 2V8\n\n\tCanada\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t+ Google Map\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPhone\n\t\t\t\t\t 250.537.2102 \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t \n\n\t\n\t\n    \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tEvent Navigation\n\t\t\n\t\t\t« GISS Dance presents Eclipse: A Collection of New Choreography\n\t\t\tGISS Dance presents Community Dance Performance »\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t"

It’s how we connect. But what makes a great story, and how can you be a better personal storyteller? Enter Deb Williams, storyteller, actor, comedienne, playwright, teacher, and co-founder and Artistic Producer of The Flame — Vancouver’s premiere storytelling event – who brings her transformative storytelling two-day workshop to Salt Spring for the first time.\nREGISTER HERE\nFrom shy beginners to the accomplished, storytellers of all ages, genders, orientations, and cultures are welcome to join a joyful, creative, and supportive space to learn the foundational rules of effective storytelling. With practice, tips, and encouraging feedback, participants will leave the workshop with several polished and meaningful stories about their life experiences. Collectively, the stories that are developed are entertaining, self-deprecating, heartfelt, unpredictable, healing, and community forming.\nMake new friends, become confident in crafting and presenting your stories, and leave listening, observing, and seeing your life as a story-filled venture!\nThis is a TWO-DAY workshop, and participants must be able to attend both days (Jan 20 and 21, 10am – 4pm each day).

Classes will focus on learning repertoire including pop, folk, classical, and music from all over the world. Our most recent concert included songs by Imagine Dragons, the Beatles, a Hawaiian folk song, children’s nursery rhyme arrangement, and a gospel spiritual. Singers will be exposed to a wide variety of styles and singing techniques.\nClasses will also focus on developing healthy singing techniques for individuals and choral ensembles, as well as a focus on reading music using Kodaly methodologies. The name Makana is the Hawaiian word for “gift” and these classes offer a gift that will stay with your children for the rest of their lives.\nParent/Guardian will need to complete a Waiver Form.\nThe Makana Youth Choirs are directed by Caroni Young. She is a sought-after music educator and clinician. Caroni strongly believes in music education for children, and has worked as a music teacher and choir director for several school districts. Her passion is singing and choral music and she believes that everyone can sing! Caroni graduated from UBC this spring with a Masters of Choral Conducting, where she was directing large university choirs ranging from 20 to 130 singers. She is the current artistic director of Viva Chorale! community choir and directs the Vancouver Youth Choir ensemble “Tiny” for children in Kindergarten to grade two.\nPlease email Caroni if you have any questions.\nWe look forward to singing with you!\n \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t Details \n\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tDate:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t April 21, 2023 \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tTime:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t3:00 pm - 5:00 pm\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\tSeries: \n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tMakana Youth Choirs — Spring Term\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tCost:\n\t\t\t\t $147 \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tEvent Categories: ArtSpring Presents, ArtSpring Presents 2022-2023, Youth\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\tOrganizer\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tArtSpring Presents\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPhone\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t250.537.2102\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tEmail\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttickets@artspring.ca\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tView Organizer Website\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t Venue \n\t\n\t\t\t\t ArtSpring – Lobby \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n100 Jackson Avenue\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\tSalt Spring Island,\n\n\tBC\n\n\tV8K 2V8\n\n\tCanada\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t+ Google Map\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPhone\n\t\t\t\t\t 250.537.2102 \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAdd to calendar\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tGoogle Calendar\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tiCalendar\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tOutlook 365\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tOutlook Live\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t Details \n\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tDate:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t April 21, 2023 \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tTime:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t3:00 pm - 5:00 pm\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\tSeries: \n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tMakana Youth Choirs — Spring Term\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tCost:\n\t\t\t\t $147 \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tEvent Categories: ArtSpring Presents, ArtSpring Presents 2022-2023, Youth\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\tOrganizer\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tArtSpring Presents\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPhone\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t250.537.2102\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tEmail\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttickets@artspring.ca\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tView Organizer Website\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t Venue \n\t\n\t\t\t\t ArtSpring – Lobby \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n100 Jackson Avenue\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\tSalt Spring Island,\n\n\tBC\n\n\tV8K 2V8\n\n\tCanada\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t+ Google Map\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPhone\n\t\t\t\t\t 250.537.2102 \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t \n\n\t\n\t\n    \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tEvent Navigation\n\t\t\n\t\t\t« Constantinople and Marco Beasley\n\t\t\tARCHIPELAGO OPENING EVENT »\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t"

Music is a gift that will stay with you for your whole life. This choir is a fun opportunity to sing with other children and to focus specifically on developing good vocal habits at a young age. Students will focus on concepts of vocal technique that include; resonance, voice placement, control and confidence while singing. The class will include instruction in music literacy and a focus on developing the ear. Makana will also develop the students’ ability to sing in an ensemble. Focus will be placed on singing in harmony, blend and balance. Each term will end in a performance in the ArtSpring theatre.\nWho: Children grades 2 – 5Where: ArtSpringWhen: Fridays 3:30pm – 4:30pmFall Term: September 17 – November 26, 2021 (concert – Friday November 26 @ 7:30pm). Spring Term: January 28 – May 27, 2021 (concert – Friday May 27 @ 7:30pm)\nFee: $147 per term – Financial Assistance is available upon requestRegistration: ArtSpring Box Office – space is limited to 12 singersBox office open by phone only: Please call 250.537.2102 or email tickets@artspring.caParent/Guardian will need to complete a Waiver Form\nSafety: Please see below.Questions?: Please email makana@artspring.ca\nThe Makana Youth Choir is directed by Caroni Young.

Here is what he says about the exhibit:\n“A few years ago a CBC  radio interview discussed the concern expressed by several municipalities regarding roadside memorials. They have been identified as “distracting” to drivers, and targeted for removal. Yet, many individuals are adamantly opposed to any removal. One wonders why?\nExploring this question, I concentrate on exploring the ‘liminal’ status of such sites and their power to remind us of our mortality as well as their ‘shamanic’ value in connecting between this world and the ‘other’.  I present to you a portfolio of images designed to raise awareness of the (often subliminal) emotional  issues of roadside memorials in a society that increasingly seeks to marginalize death.“\n*Please note an opening reception takes place Monday, August 4 at 5:00 p.m. and an artist talk takes place on Saturday, August 9 at 2:00 p.m. \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t Details \n\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tDate:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t August 10, 2014 \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tTime:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t10:00 am - 4:00 pm\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tEvent Category: Gallery Exhibits & Events\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\tOrganizer\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tGreg Klassen\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tEmail\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmulberry@xplornet.com\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t Venue \n\t\n\t\t\t\t ArtSpring – Gallery \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n100 Jackson Avenue\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\tSalt Spring Island,\n\n\n\tV8K 2V8\n\n\tCanada\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t+ Google Map\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPhone\n\t\t\t\t\t 250.537.2102 \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAdd to calendar\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tGoogle Calendar\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tiCalendar\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tOutlook 365\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tOutlook Live\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t Details \n\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tDate:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t August 10, 2014 \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tTime:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t10:00 am - 4:00 pm\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tEvent Category: Gallery Exhibits & Events\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\tOrganizer\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tGreg Klassen\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tEmail\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmulberry@xplornet.com\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t Venue \n\t\n\t\t\t\t ArtSpring – Gallery \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n100 Jackson Avenue\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\tSalt Spring Island,\n\n\n\tV8K 2V8\n\n\tCanada\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t+ Google Map\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPhone\n\t\t\t\t\t 250.537.2102 \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t \n\n\t\n\t\n    \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tEvent Navigation\n\t\t\n\t\t\t« Moore Family Exhibit: Opening Reception\n\t\t\tOUT INNERSPACE DANCE THEATRE: CREATIVE RESIDENCY INFORMAL PERFORMANCE »\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t"

Here we find the magic of Gilbert and Sullivan at its very best. With Gilbert’s cutting wit and many-layered plots paired with Sullivan’s inspired melodies which fit any lyric and any mood, it is easy to acknowledge this nautical comic opera as one of their best.\nWe have an array of memorable characters such as the Captain, Dick Deadeye, Sir Joseph Porter, and of course Little Buttercup, not to mention the “sisters and the cousins, and the aunts”, who all poke gentle fun at the law, the government, at romance, and at the social conventions of the day. Combine this with finely-crafted music, memorable rhythms and melodies, and you are sure to be swept away in the adventures. Join us on the Quarterdeck for an evening of fun!\n \nBUY TICKETS\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t Details \n\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tDate:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t June 9, 2018 \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tTime:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t7:30 pm - 9:30 pm\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tCost:\n\t\t\t\t $5 – $20 \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tEvent Category: Rental\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\tOrganizer\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tBach on the Rock\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t Other \n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Tickets \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\ttickets.artspring.ca\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t Venue \n\t\n\t\t\t\t ArtSpring – Theatre \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n100 Jackson Avenue\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\tSalt Spring Island,\n\n\tBC\n\n\tV8K 2V8\n\n\tCanada\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t+ Google Map\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPhone\n\t\t\t\t\t 250.537.2102 \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAdd to calendar\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tGoogle Calendar\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tiCalendar\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tOutlook 365\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tOutlook Live\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t Details \n\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tDate:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t June 9, 2018 \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tTime:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t7:30 pm - 9:30 pm\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tCost:\n\t\t\t\t $5 – $20 \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tEvent Category: Rental\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\tOrganizer\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tBach on the Rock\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t Other \n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Tickets \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\ttickets.artspring.ca\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t Venue \n\t\n\t\t\t\t ArtSpring – Theatre \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n100 Jackson Avenue\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\tSalt Spring Island,\n\n\tBC\n\n\tV8K 2V8\n\n\tCanada\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t+ Google Map\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPhone\n\t\t\t\t\t 250.537.2102 \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t \n\n\t\n\t\n    \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tEvent Navigation\n\t\t\n\t\t\t« GISPA: Orpheus & Eurydice\n\t\t\tGISS Music Year End Performance »\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t"

It’s how we connect. But what makes a great story, and how can you be a better personal storyteller?\n \nEnter Deb Williams, storyteller, actor, comedienne, playwright, teacher, and co-founder and Artistic Producer of The Flame—Vancouver’s premiere storytelling event—who once again brings her transformative storytelling two-day workshop to Salt Spring. From shy beginners to the accomplished, storytellers of all ages, genders, orientations, and cultures are welcome to join a joyful, creative, and supportive space to learn the foundational rules of effective storytelling.\nWith practice, tips, and encouraging feedback, participants will leave the workshop with several polished and meaningful stories about their life experiences. Collectively, the stories that are developed are entertaining, self-deprecating, heartfelt, unpredictable, healing, and community forming. Make new friends, become confident in crafting and presenting your stories, and leave listening, observing, and seeing your life as a story-filled venture!\nThis is a TWO-DAY workshop, and participants must be able to attend both days (Jan 18 + 19, 10am – 4pm each day).\nREGISTER HERE\nPrice for both days is $100 + GST.\nRegister online or call the Box Office.\nSpace is limited.\nSun Jan 19 | Performance of Stories in the Gallery |  7:30pm | $10  | with musical guest Blair Francis | Tickets online or at the door.\nBUY TICKETS \n \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t Details \n\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tDate:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t January 19, 2025 \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tTime:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t10:00 am - 4:00 pm\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\tSeries: \n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tTHE FLAME: Storytelling Workshop\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tCost:\n\t\t\t\t $100 \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tEvent Category: ArtSpring Presents 2024-2025\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\tOrganizer\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tArtSpring\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t Venue \n\t\n\t\t\t\t ArtSpring – Gallery \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n100 Jackson Avenue\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\tSalt Spring Island,\n\n\n\tV8K 2V8\n\n\tCanada\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t+ Google Map\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPhone\n\t\t\t\t\t 250.537.2102 \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAdd to calendar\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tGoogle Calendar\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tiCalendar\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tOutlook 365\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tOutlook Live\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t Details \n\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tDate:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t January 19, 2025 \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tTime:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t10:00 am - 4:00 pm\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\tSeries: \n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tTHE FLAME: Storytelling Workshop\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tCost:\n\t\t\t\t $100 \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tEvent Category: ArtSpring Presents 2024-2025\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\tOrganizer\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tArtSpring\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t Venue \n\t\n\t\t\t\t ArtSpring – Gallery \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n100 Jackson Avenue\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\tSalt Spring Island,\n\n\n\tV8K 2V8\n\n\tCanada\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t+ Google Map\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPhone\n\t\t\t\t\t 250.537.2102 \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t \n\n\t\n\t\n    \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tEvent Navigation\n\t\t\n\t\t\t« VICTORIA BAROQUE\n\t\t\tTHE FLAME WORKSHOP PERFORMANCES »\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t"

The longest and boldest bridge of the time, it was to span the Bosporus and to link Europe and Asia. But it was never built. The plans, however, were preserved in the artist’s archives. Five centuries later, Marco Beasley, a leading figure in renaissance music, and Constantinople’s soloists immerse us in the imaginary and audacious world of da Vinci’s drawings, with works belonging to the repertoires of two centres of musical culture of the time – Persia and the Ottoman Empire, and renaissance Italy.\nBUY TICKETS\nKiya Tabassian – Setar & Artistic director\nTanya LaPerrière – Baroque violin & viola d’amore\nDidem Başar – Kanun\nPatrick Graham – Percussions\nMarco Beasley – Tenor\nFabio Accurso – Lute\nStefano Rocco – Archlute, baroque guitar\nMarco Ferrari – Flute\nWith intermission.\nThank you to Michael Pidgeon for sponsoring this performance.\nPhoto: Juan Manuel Lobatón\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t Details \n\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tDate:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t April 19, 2023 \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tTime:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t7:30 pm - 9:30 pm\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tCost:\n\t\t\t\t $5 – $30 \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tEvent Categories: ArtSpring Presents, ArtSpring Presents 2022-2023\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\tOrganizer\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tArtSpring Presents\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPhone\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t250.537.2102\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tEmail\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttickets@artspring.ca\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tView Organizer Website\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t Venue \n\t\n\t\t\t\t ArtSpring – Theatre \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n100 Jackson Avenue\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\tSalt Spring Island,\n\n\tBC\n\n\tV8K 2V8\n\n\tCanada\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t+ Google Map\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPhone\n\t\t\t\t\t 250.537.2102 \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAdd to calendar\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tGoogle Calendar\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tiCalendar\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tOutlook 365\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tOutlook Live\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t Details \n\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tDate:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t April 19, 2023 \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tTime:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t7:30 pm - 9:30 pm\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tCost:\n\t\t\t\t $5 – $30 \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tEvent Categories: ArtSpring Presents, ArtSpring Presents 2022-2023\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\tOrganizer\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tArtSpring Presents\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPhone\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t250.537.2102\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tEmail\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttickets@artspring.ca\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tView Organizer Website\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t Venue \n\t\n\t\t\t\t ArtSpring – Theatre \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n100 Jackson Avenue\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\tSalt Spring Island,\n\n\tBC\n\n\tV8K 2V8\n\n\tCanada\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t+ Google Map\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPhone\n\t\t\t\t\t 250.537.2102 \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t \n\n\t\n\t\n    \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tEvent Navigation\n\t\t\n\t\t\t« The Met – Der Rosenkavalier\n\t\t\tMakana Youth Choirs — Spring Term »\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t"

Join us as we tell a story of love, loss, creation, constellations, and tragedy.\nBUY TICKETS\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t Details \n\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tDate:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t June 6, 2018 \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tTime:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t7:30 pm - 9:30 pm\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\tSeries: \n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tGISPA: Orpheus & Eurydice\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tCost:\n\t\t\t\t $15.00 \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tEvent Category: Rental\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\tOrganizer\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tGISPA\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t Other \n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Tickets \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\ttickets.artspring.ca\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t Venue \n\t\n\t\t\t\t ArtSpring – Theatre \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n100 Jackson Avenue\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\tSalt Spring Island,\n\n\tBC\n\n\tV8K 2V8\n\n\tCanada\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t+ Google Map\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPhone\n\t\t\t\t\t 250.537.2102 \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAdd to calendar\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tGoogle Calendar\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tiCalendar\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tOutlook 365\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tOutlook Live\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t Details \n\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tDate:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t June 6, 2018 \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tTime:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t7:30 pm - 9:30 pm\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\tSeries: \n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tGISPA: Orpheus & Eurydice\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tCost:\n\t\t\t\t $15.00 \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tEvent Category: Rental\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\tOrganizer\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tGISPA\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t Other \n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Tickets \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\ttickets.artspring.ca\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t Venue \n\t\n\t\t\t\t ArtSpring – Theatre \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n100 Jackson Avenue\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\tSalt Spring Island,\n\n\tBC\n\n\tV8K 2V8\n\n\tCanada\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t+ Google Map\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPhone\n\t\t\t\t\t 250.537.2102 \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t \n\n\t\n\t\n    \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tEvent Navigation\n\t\t\n\t\t\t« GISPA: Orpheus & Eurydice\n\t\t\tGISPA: Orpheus & Eurydice »\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t"

Together, they have been a life force not only in the art world, but in fundraising for and awareness of environmental causes.\nPartners in life, in the studio, and in world travels, they have amassed a fascinating private collection from fellow artists who inspired the artistry within themselves, as well as cultural artifacts from adventure and advocacy journeys to Africa, Asia, both Poles, and here in the Pacific Northwest.\nHundreds of paintings, prints, sculptures, Indigenous pieces, fine art photography, personal family photos and story-filled artifacts have been meticulously curated by Zoe Zafiris-Casey and are being moved by hand from the Batemans’ home and storage to ArtSpring’s gallery for the first and only time.\nThank you to Seth Berkowitz Photography for sponsoring this exhibition.\nREAD MORE ABOUT THE EXHIBITION\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t Details \n\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tDate:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t May 17, 2025 \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tTime:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t4:00 pm - 6:00 pm\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tEvent Category: Gallery Exhibits & Events\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\tOrganizer\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tArtSpring\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t Venue \n\t\n\t\t\t\t ArtSpring – Gallery \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n100 Jackson Avenue\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\tSalt Spring Island,\n\n\n\tV8K 2V8\n\n\tCanada\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t+ Google Map\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPhone\n\t\t\t\t\t 250.537.2102 \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAdd to calendar\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tGoogle Calendar\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tiCalendar\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tOutlook 365\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tOutlook Live\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t Details \n\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tDate:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t May 17, 2025 \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tTime:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t4:00 pm - 6:00 pm\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tEvent Category: Gallery Exhibits & Events\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\tOrganizer\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tArtSpring\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t Venue \n\t\n\t\t\t\t ArtSpring – Gallery \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n100 Jackson Avenue\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\tSalt Spring Island,\n\n\n\tV8K 2V8\n\n\tCanada\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t+ Google Map\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPhone\n\t\t\t\t\t 250.537.2102 \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t \n\n\t\n\t\n    \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tEvent Navigation\n\t\t\n\t\t\t« MET OPERA: Salome (Strauss)\n\t\t\tCONFLUENCE: The Bateman Collection »\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t"

It has now evolved to represent the universal human anxiety about what lies beyond life, the weight of decisions that shape one’s fate, and the uncertainty of venturing into uncharted territory.\nWith “Undiscovered Country” seven local artists are sharing their interpretations of Shakespeare’s quote. The contemporary exhibition at ArtSpring Gallery offers new works in a rich variety of mediums including photography, mixed media, sculpture, and conceptual art.\nThe artists have developed deeply personal narratives around this theme which will take visitors on a visual voyage of unknown realms, extending the concept from physical spaces to the human mind and soul.\nExhibiting artists are Susan Benson, Seth Berkowitz, Anna Gustafson, Jane MacKenzie, April Mackey, Anette Schrage, and Michela Sorrentino.\nOpen Daily 10am-4pm and before theatre performances.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t Details \n\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tDate:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t April 5, 2025 \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tTime:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t5:00 pm - 7:00 pm\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tEvent Categories: Gallery Exhibits & Events, Rental\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\tOrganizer\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tSeth Berkowitz\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tView Organizer Website\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t Venue \n\t\n\t\t\t\t ArtSpring – Gallery \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n100 Jackson Avenue\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\tSalt Spring Island,\n\n\n\tV8K 2V8\n\n\tCanada\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t+ Google Map\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPhone\n\t\t\t\t\t 250.537.2102 \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAdd to calendar\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tGoogle Calendar\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tiCalendar\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tOutlook 365\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tOutlook Live\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t Details \n\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tDate:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t April 5, 2025 \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tTime:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t5:00 pm - 7:00 pm\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tEvent Categories: Gallery Exhibits & Events, Rental\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\tOrganizer\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tSeth Berkowitz\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tView Organizer Website\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t Venue \n\t\n\t\t\t\t ArtSpring – Gallery \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n100 Jackson Avenue\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\tSalt Spring Island,\n\n\n\tV8K 2V8\n\n\tCanada\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t+ Google Map\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPhone\n\t\t\t\t\t 250.537.2102 \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t \n\n\t\n\t\n    \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tEvent Navigation\n\t\t\n\t\t\t« SS Forum: How Did We Get Here?\n\t\t\tSARAH HAGEN: Goldberg Variations »\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t"
