        "@value": "\n\t\t\t\nTicket Policies\n\n\n\nRefunds\n\n\n\nIn the event that a presentation is rescheduled by DanceHouse your tickets will remain valid for any future dates.\n\n\n\nIn the event that a presentation is cancelled by DanceHouse, purchasers will be given the option to receive a full refund, donate their ticket or receive a credit for select future performances. \n\n\n\nIf you are unable to attend a performance for any reason, you may gift your ticket to a friend or family member. Alternatively, you may donate the value of your ticket (at least 24 hours in advance of the performance) for a tax-deductible donation receipt. \n\n\n\nExchanges\n\n\n\nTickets may be exchanged for a performance day/night of the same presentation, subject to availability. An exchange fee may be charged. Please contact the box office at least 48 hours in advance of the performance and we will try our best to accommodate your request.\n\n\n\nIf upgrading your seat, the difference in price will be charged. We are not able to offer refunds if choosing to switch into a less expensive night or seat. \n\n\n\nLost Tickets\n\n\n\nA new copy of lost tickets can be sent to the email of the original purchaser or printed at will-call on the night of the performance. \n\n\n\nAge of Entry\n\n\n\nEach person regardless of age must have a valid ticket to enter a performance. \n\n\n\nMany presentations contain material that may not be suitable for younger audiences. It is strongly recommended that children under 8 years of age not be brought to the theatre except for specifically advertised family-friendly presentations. DanceHouse does not censor performances or make any guarantees of show content. We encourage parents to use their discretion when deciding if a show is appropriate for their child. Feel free to contact us if you need more information about a specific performance.\n\n\n\nChildren must be able to sit quietly throughout the performance or event to ensure they are not disruptive to performers or other patrons. Patrons with preschool aged children may be re-seated near an exit at the Front of House Supervisor’s discretion, and be directed by an usher to leave the venue at any time.\n\n\n\nLatecomers\n\n\n\nLatecomers will be seated at the discretion of the Front of House staff. In the case of a performance with assigned seating, latecomers forgo their right to their reserved seat and will be seated at the back of the auditorium or in the most easily accessible seats. If there is an intermission, patrons who were late arriving can find their reserved seat location during the intermission.\n\n\n\nPayment Methods\n\n\n\nVISA, Mastercard, and VISA & Mastercard Debit are accepted online. VISA, Mastercard or Cash (exact change only) will be accepted at the theatre. Please contact the box office at least 72 hours in advance if you would like to arrange payment by debit or pay by cash in advance. \n\n\n\nDynamic Pricing\n\n\n\nIn some instances, DanceHouse presentations may have ticket and fee prices that adjust over time based on demand. This is similar to how airline tickets and hotel rooms are sold and is commonly referred to as “Dynamic Pricing.”\n\n\n\nMailing Fees\n\n\n\nIn the case that a mailed ticket is requested, mailing fees may be charged to cover the costs of sending you your tickets and/or passes in the mail. Any mailing fees will be detailed at the time of purchase. Tickets and passes are mailed via Canada Post and subject to Canada Post delivery times.\n\n\n\nDanceHouse is not responsible for lost or stolen tickets in the mail. Mailed tickets will not be available for performances within 7 days of the purchase date.\n\n\n\nTerms and Conditions\n\n\n\nRead DanceHouse’s complete terms and conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\t\t"

Check on the event page to see whether the performance you attend will feature one of these talks. This is an excellent opportunity to gain insight into the presentation you are about to experience.\n\n\n\nAll dates, times, and guests, will be announced on the relevant show-specific page.\n\n\n\nMasterclasses\n\n\n\nEach time DanceHouse brings a company into town, it comes with perks for the Vancouver community! DanceHouse engages visiting companies and artists in a series of local masterclasses, reaching beyond the stage and directly into the studio. Join a DanceHouse masterclass and learn directly from the exceptional artists you are about to see on stage!\n\n\n\nEach masterclass is presented through community partnerships. Partners include Arts Umbrella, Harbour Dance Centre, and Lamondance Training and Performing Company, among others.\n\n\n\nUpcoming masterclasses can be found here.\n\n\n\nPost-Show Social \n\n\n\nJoin us following a Friday performance at the Vancouver Playhouse for the Post-Show Social. This is your chance to meet and chat with the artists and members of the company who performed, while also getting to know members of the DanceHouse team and board of directors. Everyone is welcome.\n\n\n\n15X15 Young Adult Tickets\n\n\n\nDanceHouse believes that young people in our community should have more access to the arts, which is why we created our 15X15 Young Adult ticket program, which provides discounted tickets to young adults, who have low income, at each performance. Learn more here.\n\n\n\nPhoto © Maja Giannoccaro\n\n\n\n\n\t\t"

Louise spent her life working and volunteering for many dance and theatre organizations, in addition to her numerous charitable activities in support of the performing arts and social justice communities of the Lower Mainland.

Her diverse upbringing as a fourth-generation Indian-Singaporean and first/second-generation Canadian has deeply influenced her creative research on migration, its stresses, and its transformations. Ashvini’s collaborative works have been presented by prominent organizations, including Tangente, the Dancing on the Edge Festival, CanAsian Dance, and the Dance Centre, among others. She remains a disciple of the acclaimed bharatanatyam danseuse Rama Vaidyanathan, whose artistry is widely regarded for its spiritual depth and ability to bridge tradition with a transcendent experience. This focus on spiritual resonance and the pursuit of inner truth deeply influences Ashvini’s own practice, as she seeks to carry this sacredness into her performances, creating a dialogue between tradition, identity, and personal transformation. Currently in development, her solo work CROSSING DEEP WATERS explores the layered terrain of identity shaped by what is lost, carried, or transformed across geographies and generations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout the 2023 Recipients\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n  \n    \n    \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\nLivona Ellis – Winner\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLivona Ellis was born in Vancouver on the unceded territories of the Coast Salish Peoples.

In addition to the performances on stage, DanceHouse offers a suite of engagement opportunities and a chance for members of the general public and the local artistic community to engage with the presented artists and their work.\n\n\n\nDanceHouse was founded by Barb Clausen and Jim Smith and is a program of Seismic Shift Arts Society, a provincial non-profit society and a federally registered charitable organization. Registered charitable number: 86128 4255 RR0001 | GST number: 86128 4255 RT0001\n\n\n\nVision\n\n\n\nA globally-connected Vancouver where people value and embrace creativity and the arts as essential to an inclusive civil society, cultural identity, and quality of life.\n\n\n\nMission\n\n\n\nDanceHouse presents exceptional international calibre dance of scale to engage, inform and challenge, and to offer transformative cultural experiences for Vancouver audiences.\n\n\n\nValues\n\n\n\n\nDiversity.

We consistently deliver a high quality experience for patrons, including but not limited to ticket sales, venue experience, staged artistic offerings and auxiliary engagement opportunities. We build the public’s trust that we will deliver quality and engaging work. We comply with high management standards to ensure long-term financial sustainability. We stand behind the artistic integrity of the high calibre work that we present. We ensure that our donors and supporters are appropriately recognized. We take pride in our contribution to Vancouver’s vibrant cultural landscape.\n\n\n\nAudience Experience. Through the artistic works we present, audiences have the opportunity to experience and respond in a physical, emotional, or intellectual way. We hope the entire theatre experience is positive for the audience – the physical venue. The experience of sharing the audience “group experience” is a positive and open opportunity to share a common experience. DanceHouse strives to offer challenging and engaging international dance to our audiences.\n\n\n\nEducation. We believe in fostering a deeper understanding of dance through dialogue and the sharing of the experience and knowledge.\n\n\n\nAccessibility.

Recognizing that the situation remains in a state of flux, adjustments to procedures and protocols will be made as needed. These guidelines are in accordance with current regulations. More information on current restrictions and guidelines can be found on the Government of British Columbia website.\n\n\n\nThe basics of keeping each other safe remain the same:\n\n\n\n\nStay home if you are feeling ill or may have been exposed to Covid-19.\n\n\n\nRespect the social distancing rule, both indoors and outdoors.\n\n\n\nWearing a mask that covers your mouth, nose and chin when entering indoor spaces and moving around common areas is encouraged.\n\n\n\nFrequently wash your hands or use hand-sanitizing stations.\n\n\n\n\nWhile attending DanceHouse events, please follow the directives of our staff and volunteers – our aim is to help keep you and everyone around you safe and healthy. DanceHouse maintains a zero tolerance policy for harassment and abusive language or behaviour towards our staff, volunteers, artists and other patrons.

        "@value": "\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nMessage from the Artistic Director\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt can sometimes feel like the world is coming apart at the seams. Fracture, fragmentation, and division are rampant, not only in the political and social arenas but increasingly in our own hearts and minds. One moment, you’re fomenting for revolution, the next you simply want to find a hidey hole and retreat from everything.\n\n\n\nBut I noticed something when I looked at the 2025/26 DanceHouse Season.\n\n\n\nIn all of these very different productions, the work of making things that are meaningful, powerful and beautiful shines out. It doesn’t matter if you’re from Australia, Hungary, Taiwan, or Canada; the necessity of art brings us together in a kind of creative transcendence.\n\n\n\nThroughout history, when all the political struggles and daily existence have fallen away, art and culture have endured. There’s a reason that Shakespeare’s epic drama Hamlet continues to rivet our attention hundreds of years after its writing. It still speaks to the issues that have long beset human beings and our ability to transform the raw material of pain, struggle, and suffering into something numinous.\n\n\n\nWe are very excited to launch the upcoming season with Daniel Léveillé’s masterwork Amour, acide et noix (Love, Acid and Nuts). Winner of the Dora Mavor Moore Award for Best New Choreography in 2004, this extraordinary piece returns with a critical lesson about the struggle for intimacy and contact. Using the naked body, Léveillé offers a profound meditation on the human condition.\n\n\n\nEmploying a head piece called “Ling Zi” that incorporates pheasant tail feathers worn in traditional Chinese opera to represent warrior’s power and skill, Taiwan’s Hung Dance summons the wildest of spirits in Birdy. With subversive wit and style, this fascinating work explicates Taiwan’s past, present and future with grace and power.\n\n\n\nUnder the direction of artistic director and choreographer Bence Vági, Hungary’s cirque dance company Recirquel invests traditional circus acts with a spiritual intelligence and emotional profundity, transfiguring feats of strength and agility into iconographic images in Paradisum. \n\n\n\nEx Machina + Côté Danse reinvent Shakespeare’s archetypal drama into something new and immediate in Hamlet, Prince of Denmark. The nine members of Côté Danse engage with existential questions of being and nothingness through the iconic characters of Shakespeare’s most famous play. Through the universal language of dance, co-creators Robert Lepage and Guillaume Côté create a play without words that still speaks to the ages.\n\n\n\nWe’re closing out the season with a bang with Manifesto from Australia’s Stephanie Lake Company. Drawing inspiration from the primeval connection between drumming and dancing, Manifesto fuses together a wide variety of different dance styles. The work pairs nine drummers and nine dancers into a battalion of attack and rhythm, creating a choreographic fission.\n\n\n\nNo other art form is quite as steeped in collective effort as dance. It’s not just the choreographer or the performers on stage but the many people working behind the scenes to make shows happen, lighting designers, stage managers, and costume designers. From the ushers who hand out programs to the volunteers who give freely of their time, it all comes together in the creative crucible that is live performance. If you’ve been thinking about becoming a subscriber, do it now! As a DanceHouse subscriber, you won’t miss a single performance.\n\n\n\nA quote attributed to Winston Churchill about cutting funding to the arts to support the efforts of the Second World War resulted in the famous statement: “Then what would we be fighting for?”\n\n\n\nIn all its polarizing contradiction, I believe that the world is still worth fighting for. We’re in this together, after all.\n\n\n\nJim Smith\n\n\n\nArtistic Director\n\n\n\nPhoto: Jim Smith © Rebecca Ross\n\t\t"

Prior to her career in law, she trained in ballet, contemporary and jazz dance in Edmonton, Alberta. She is a strong supporter of the arts, especially dance, and is looking forward to helping bring more DanceHouse into everyone’s life.\n\n\n\n“I support DanceHouse because it provides programming that challenges our expectations and provokes conversation.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlexandra Barker\n\n\n\nVice-President\n\n\n\nAlexandra Barker works in finance at a local infrastructure investment company, and has been a DanceHouse board member since 2018. She has participated in many committees during her time on the board, including Finance (serving as past Treasurer), DanceHouse One, and Advocacy. \n\n\n\n“I support DanceHouse because it elevates Vancouver’s culture and provides incredible opportunities to see world-class performances.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnndraya Luui\n\n\n\nVice-President\n\n\n\nAnndraya Luui is a sometime Director Corporate Communications, and a full-time supporter of arts and culture in Greater Vancouver. She is associated with the two boards of The Scotiabank Dance Centre: The Dance Foundation, and The Dance Centre Society, as well as Wen Wei Dance and DanceHouse. She focuses her energy on building audiences, particularly in engaging underprivileged youth and marginalized groups. She would like to see more engagement and participation with the public for the arts, starting with ticket buying and attendance, and from there some donor support.\n\n\n\n“I support DanceHouse because I appreciate its unique position in the dance offerings of Vancouver, and it delivers according to its mission: a large scale, international, contemporary dance season. There are numerous other reputable festivals and fine presenters in the city, but they don’t do exactly the same thing.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIvy Arcos Dahm\n\n\n\nTreasurer\n\n\n\nIvy Arcos Dahm has worked in international trade, economic development, and cooperation. Through her work with the private sector and international organisations, she has witnessed firsthand how cultural exchange, often facilitated by trade, enhances mutual understanding and respect for global artistic traditions.\n\n\n\n“I support DanceHouse because it brings to Vancouver incredible dance performances that showcase dance as a celebration of our shared humanity and the beauty of our differences. I feel particularly proud to support DanceHouse because I am constantly and consistently wowed by its work in bringing local, national, and world-renowned dance artists to Vancouver.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChristopher Stott\n\n\n\nSecretary\n\n\n\nWorking in Vancouver’s tech sector, as founder at buddybuild, Christopher Stott is surrounded by innovation and is consistently impressed by the innovative artists DanceHouse brings to Vancouver.\n\n\n\n“I support DanceHouse because it brings incredible international art to the Vancouver stage.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLiesl Jauk\n\n\n\nPast President\n\n\n\nLiesl Jauk is the Manager of Arts Services for the City of Richmond. Prior to joining the City in 2008, as co-founder of Rebus Creative, she co-produced The Word On The Street Festival and BC Book Prizes as well as provided marketing and graphic design services for a range of clients in Vancouver’s arts community. Liesl has an extensive educational and professional background in fine arts including a Masters degree in the Social History of Art, coupled with a keen interest in and passion for the arts, craft and urban design. She is a past board member of the Public Dreams Society, DOXA Documentary Film Festival and The Holy Body Tattoo and is currently on the board of the Mortal Coil Performance Society and the Society to Bridge Arts and Community (BC Alliance for Arts + Culture).\n\n\n\n“I support DanceHouse because I love being part of making transformative arts experiences part of what it means to live in Vancouver.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKyle Bienvenu\n\n\n\nDirector\n\n\n\nKyle Bienvenu, C.D., is a lawyer practicing in the areas of commercial litigation, construction disputes, and professional discipline. Prior to his career in law, Kyle danced professionally with Decidedly Jazz Danceworks and Ballet Victoria. Although he always misses being a performer, Kyle enthusiastically stays connected to the arts and dance communities as a member of the DanceHouse board.\n\n\n\n“I support DanceHouse because it celebrates dance by exposing new and experienced audiences to exceptional performances.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSara Getz\n\n\n\nDirector\n\n\n\nSara grew up fighting a career in the arts, but in 1998, she relented and went to work for the Arts Club Theatre as a telemarketer. After 3 months, she was hooked – on a career in the arts, not a career in telemarketing. Since that first job, Sara has worked for a variety of Lower Mainland arts organizations including Arts Club Theatre, Vancouver Opera, Vancouver East Cultural Centre and the Vancouver Recital Society.\n\n\n\nAfter a brief arts hiatus, during which she worked at St. George’s School, BC Children’s Hospital Foundation and BCIT and had her first child, she returned to the Vancouver Recital Society where, in addition to being the Manager of Development & Donor Relations, she has for the last two years worn the hat of Curmudgeon in the Corner – or General Manager, if you want to be technical.\n\n\n\n“I support DanceHouse because I believe it makes a vital contribution to our local community and the dance community at large. I love and appreciate everything about the organization: I’m inspired by the passion and commitment of the staff and of my fellow board members, and the engagement, support and enthusiasm of our audiences is energizing.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Paula Meyler\n\n\n\nDirector\n\n\n\nDr Paula Meyler is a physician whose interests include clinical anesthesiology, pain medicine, medical education and simulation. She is also a former ballet dancer originally from Montreal and is proud to make her new home here in Vancouver.\n\n\n\n“I support DanceHouse because it brings world class dance to a sophisticated Vancouver audience.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShawna Quinton\n\n\n\nDirector\n\n\n\nShawna Quinton works in financial operations for startups and small businesses. Shealso has experience serving on corporate boards of directors. She loves a goodspreadsheet and the insights that data analysis can offer. Shawna believesorganizational culture is a critical driver of venture success and is looking forward tocontributing to that culture at DanceHouse.\n\n\n\n“I support DanceHouse because of the energizing spectacle that the performers bringto the audience. I’m always inspired by what I see on stage at DanceHouse.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJeff Sheremeta\n\n\n\nDirector\n\n\n\nJeff Sheremeta is a corporate lawyer with a wide experience working with entrepreneurial groups in industries including software, technology and mining. He started his career with a six-year stint at Lang Michener (now McMillan LLP) and went on to be a co-founder of several companies including Versapay Corporation. He received his law degree from the University of British Columbia in 1997 and an MBA from Queen’s University in 2005. He spends his spare time actively fighting the cliche that lawyers are too boring to care about the arts.\n\n\n\n“I support DanceHouse because I really believe that the arts are an important part of a happy life, and because DanceHouse changed my notions of what dance could be while also allowing me to experience some of the best and most memorable shows I have ever seen.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNancy Stern\n\n\n\nDirector\n\n\n\nNancy is a local architect focusing on commercial and residential projects.

If DanceHouse has made a positive impact in your life or the life of someone you know, leaving a bequest to DanceHouse is a generous and greatly appreciated way to recognize this impact. With your help, we will continue to engage, inform and challenge, and to offer unique cultural experiences for Vancouver audiences for years to come. \n\n\n\nA bequest is a gift you make in your will to shape your legacy and ensure the causes you’ve cared about during your lifetime are supported for generations to come. Making a bequest at any size is a wonderful way to continue (or start!) your philanthropic giving.\n\n\n\nRecognition\n\n\n\nWe are eternally grateful to all our Dedicated to Dance Legacy Members. While there is no obligation to let us know if you have left a bequest in your will to DanceHouse, if you have left a contribution, we would be delighted to hear from you. This will allow us to let you know how much we appreciate your gift as well as have a discussion around ensuring your legacy is shaped how you would like. We would also like to recognize you in our communications and keep you up to date with the work we are doing in the community.\n\n\n\nPlease contact Jim at jim@dancehouse.ca if you are interested in discussing your gift with us. \n\n\n\nAll Dedicated to Dance Legacy Members will get the benefit of:\n\n\n\n\nRecognition in our programs and website\n\n\n\nReserved seating at pre-show talks \n\n\n\nPriority seating for new season subscriptions\n\n\n\nAdvanced single ticket access\n\n\n\nThe knowledge that your gift will contribute to creating a more globally connected Vancouver\n\n\n\nPeace of mind knowing your Executor will have clarity on how to carry out your charitable wishes\n\n\n\nYou can dedicate your gift in memory of someone dear to you\n\n\n\n\nHow it Works\n\n\n\nLeaving a gift to DanceHouse is easy to arrange and is one of the most flexible ways of giving. When writing your will, we recommend that you work with your lawyer, financial planner or accountant to ensure everything is set up correctly and in accordance with your wishes. If you have already written your will and wish to include a gift to DanceHouse you can simply make an addition by including a codicil to your existing will. A codicil is a document that amends, rather than replaces, a previously executed will.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“I was first moved to give to DanceHouse after a Speaking of Dance conversation featuring Crystal Pite on the challenges encountered by female choreographers. I was inspired to set aside ten per cent of my will to ensure DanceHouse can continue to present dance organizations from all over the world. I know that by leaving a legacy to DanceHouse I am helping to ensure the future of dance in Vancouver.”\n\n\n\n– Richard Dopson, Legacy Donor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDanceHouse can accept the following legacy gifts:\n\n\n\nBequest – legacy or residual\n\n\n\nLegacy Bequest\n\n\n\nA gift of an exact dollar amount. It can also be a particular asset, such as the stock of a certain company, a house or a car.\n\n\n\n“My estate trustees shall pay the sum of $ ______ (or transfer assets with an equal value) to Seismic Shift Arts Society*, Vancouver, BC, to support its highest priority needs.”\n\n\n\nResidual Bequest\n\n\n\nA gift of all or a percentage of your estate after all debts, taxes, administrative expenses and specific/legacies bequests have been paid. Because this type of gift leaves a percentage rather than a fixed amount, inflation will not reduce the value of your gift.\n\n\n\n“My estate trustees shall pay ______(all or %) of the residue of my estate to Seismic Shift Arts Society*, Vancouver, BC, to support its highest priority needs.”\n\n\n\nSecurities\n\n\n\nSecurities can include stocks, mutual funds, segregated funds, bonds, flow-through shares, and employee stock options.\n\n\n\nIf you own publicly traded securities outside of a registered account (RRSP, RRIF, TFSA), that have increased in value since you purchased them, you can donate them directly to DanceHouse with no tax on the capital gain. If you sold your shares during your lifetime, you would be taxed on 50% of the capital gain. \n\n\n\nConsult your financial advisor to let them know your intention to donate securities to DanceHouse. When it comes time to carry out your will, your executor would be responsible for transferring the securities to DanceHouse. A tax receipt will then be issued to your estate, thus saving on capital gains.\n\n\n\nRRSP or RRIF\n\n\n\nDesignating DanceHouse as a beneficiary of your registered plan is a straightforward and meaningful way to leave a legacy gift. Your estate will receive a charitable tax receipt to offset any taxes owing when your plan is deregistered.\n\n\n\nYou can provide for your family and donate to DanceHouse by naming more than one beneficiary.\n\n\n\nTo plan a gift of an RRSP or RRIF, obtain a change of beneficiary form from the plan administrator or your financial advisor and name Seismic Shift Arts Society* as a beneficiary of all or a percentage of your RRSP/RRIF account.\n\n\n\nLife Insurance\n\n\n\nGiving the gift of life insurance may enable you to amplify your giving power, increasing your impact in the community. With a gift of life insurance, you make periodic premium payments that can turn into a major gift. \n\n\n\nYou can donate a life insurance policy in one of the following ways:\n\n\n\n\nName Seismic Shift Arts Society* as the beneficiary of an existing policy. This is a good option if you already have a policy. DanceHouse will receive the policy proceeds and your estate will receive the tax benefits.\n\n\n\nTake out a new policy in the name of Seismic Shift Arts Society*. You’ll receive a charitable tax receipt for the cash value of the policy and for any premiums you pay.\n\n\n\nTransfer ownership of an existing fully-paid policy to Seismic Shift Arts Society* and receive a charitable tax receipt for the cash value of the policy. \n\n\n\nTransfer ownership of an existing partially-paid up policy to Seismic Shift Arts Society* and receive a charitable tax receipt for the cash value of the policy. You’ll immediately start receiving tax receipts in the amount of your payments for the annual premiums.\n\n\n\n\nReal Estate \n\n\n\nReal estate can be an effective way to make a substantial gift to DanceHouse with significant tax benefits. You can give the property outright, place it in trust to retain the use of it for life, or gift it by will. \n\n\n\nAnother way to give through real estate is to set up a charitable remainder trust, which enables you to receive immediate tax savings while retaining use of the asset. To do this, transfer a property into a trust to be managed by a trustee (a financial institution, a lawyer, yourself, or other individuals). Then, name Seismic Shift Arts Society* as the remainder beneficiary in trust. This will ensure that your property is transferred to DanceHouse when the time comes. In short, this method allows you to use the property or receive income from it during your lifetime, while receiving a tax receipt you can use today.\n\n\n\nAfter discussing with your financial advisor, contact us to indicate your interest in giving real estate.\n\n\n\nEndowment Fund\n\n\n\nAn endowment fund is an investment that uses the earnings from the investment to fund its operations, without touching the principal. \n\n\n\nAlthough endowment funds can be a valuable asset, the interest payments from an endowment can end up having less impact than you may intend. If you are considering setting up an endowment fund, we would love to first discuss with you which planned giving method will have the most impact.\n\n\n\nIf you opt to create an endowment fund, we suggest you discuss this option with your financial advisor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Charity Information\n\n\n\nLegal Name: Seismic Shift Arts Society.

Please note that the available seats you see on the map are the available seats at that time while we are still holding seats of all 2024/25 Season subscribers.

Finally, you will see a list of your tickets to all five performances in the basket.

How do I get them tickets?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a perk of subscribing, you will receive 15% off additional tickets! All subscribers are now able to  purchase additional tickets. When purchasing tickets online,  your ticket discount will be automatically applied at check out if you are logged into the account you used for the subscription. If you’d like to move your subscription seat to sit next to your guest, contact the box office.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n  \n    \n    \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\nMy friend would like to become a subscriber and we’d like to sit together. What should I do?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuy or renew your subscription online or over the phone. Your friend can then purchase a subscription in the same tier and choose their seating online or over the phone. We will try our best to sit them beside you though it may be necessary to move your subscription seat in order to accommodate the request.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n  \n    \n    \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\nI can’t attend all of the performances next season but I still want access to the many additional subscriber benefits. What should I do?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribers are able to exchange tickets from one matinee or evening performance of the presentation to another matinee or evening performance of the same presentation after May 13. If you can’t make any of the performances you can donate the tickets that you can’t use back to DanceHouse and receive a tax receipt for your donation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n  \n    \n    \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\nWhat happens if a performance has to be cancelled?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the event that a presentation needs to be rescheduled or cancelled by DanceHouse, purchasers will be given the option to receive a full refund or donate their ticket. Read our full refund policy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNeed assistance? Contact boxoffice@dancehouse.ca | 604.801.6225Daniel Léveillé Danse © Julie Artacho\n\t\t"
